For this project, Copilot generated all of the functions used to ensure that the script met the four assignment requirements. These requirements included: standardizing column names, cleaning up whitespace, handling any missing prices and quantities, and removing any rows with invalid data. I prompted it with clear comments guided by step-by-step instruction, and basic partial code structures. I found that the first versions generated by Copilot were more advanced than my coding experience, so I removed things that I deemed unnecessary (such as the unicode or ASCII), and tried to keep the script simple. 

The changes that I made to the code were with the intention of making it simpler and more cohesive. I removed unwanted blocks of code generated and made the structures more simple. The function variables also needed to be altered to match the main block added at the end of the project. I also renamed some of the variables to names that I thought matched better. Especially ones that were a singular letter, like 'i', which I replaced with 'count' for example. I think that this adds more clarity for readers so that they know what the code is specifically referring to. I also deleted all of the comments created by Copilot and added my own, so the comments are written by me.

I learned that data cleaning can be a much more tedious process than I thought! While Copilot does make the coding part easier with its assistance, the actual structure of the project comes down to you. I had a few difficulties getting the structure set up, especially trying to download pandas and trying to fix some git errors since it wouldn't let me commit sometimes. I also learned that you need to be as specific as possible using Copilot and ensuring that your business logic makes sense. Without the knowledge, it is very likely that you will make mistakes within your code and produce inaccurate results. That is why I tried to break each step down, give it clear instructions based on my knowledge and preferences, and refined the code when necessary. One thing that I found extremely helpful was Copilot's ability to correct any syntax errors. At one point, many of the variable names didn't match so I had to correct them. Copilot helped me to identify errors and make sure that my code ran smoothly. It also suggested that I should move the dropped rows to an audit file, which I liked since it would make it easier for anyone viewing the data in the future to analyze. However, I would say that its limitation is overcomplicating the code. I noticed when I would ask it to do one thing (for example, "please remove whitespace in the column names"), it would add other features (like the ASCII or unicode) that this project did not need. It can be a bit difficult to navigate using Copilot and making sure that the code it generates is suitable for your preferences unless you give it very specific instructions and go back to fix it yourself. However, I learned how to clean data using this project and how to use AI assistence via Copilot which was a useful experience. At the end of the day, it only serves as a tool that has no function unless you know the logic behind the code and how to make the necessary modifications to apply to real-world problems.
